AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup language for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, web pages, slide decks and man pages in plain text. This guide is a quick reference for the common AsciiDoc document and text formatting markup.

The Asciidoctor project is an effort to bring a comprehensive and accessible publishing toolchain, centered around the AsciiDoc syntax, to a growing range of ecosystems, including Ruby, JavaScript and the JVM.

In addition to an AsciiDoc processor and a collection of stylesheets, the project provides plugins for Maven, Gradle and Guard and packages for operating systems such as Fedora, Debian and Ubuntu. It also pushes AsciiDoc to evolve by introducing new ideas and innovation and helps promote AsciiDoc through education and advocacy.
